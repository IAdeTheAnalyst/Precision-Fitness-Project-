# Precision Fitness — Membership & Performance Dashboard

In this project, I developed a business performance dashboard in Power BI for a simulated fitness company, Precision Fitness. My objective was to transform financial and membership data into an interactive dashboard that enables leadership to monitor revenue performance, membership growth, client retention, and operational efficiency.

I focused on analyzing revenue, expenses, profit margins, trainer capacity, membership tier distribution, and client activity trends. Through structured data modeling and DAX-driven KPIs, I built an executive-ready dashboard designed to support strategic decisions around growth, retention, and profitability.

## Project Objectives
In this analysis, I aimed to answer the following business questions:
1. What is the overall **revenue, expenses, and profit margin** for Precision Fitness?  
2. How many **active clients** and **trainers** are currently engaged?  
3. What is the **distribution of memberships** across Platinum, Gold, and Silver tiers?  
4. How many memberships are **active vs expired**, and what trends emerge?  
5. Which months show the **highest and lowest membership growth**?  
6. How are individual clients performing in terms of **membership progress and activity**?  
7. What operational levers (trainer capacity, promotions, retention strategies) can drive higher profitability?

## Tools & Technical Approach
In this project, I used:
- Power BI Desktop
- Structured data modeling to connect financial, membership, and client-level data
- DAX measures to calculate revenue, expenses, profit, and margin %
- Calculated measures for active vs. expired membership ratios
- KPI cards for financial and workforce summaries
- Line charts for revenue, expense, and profit trends
- Donut/Pie charts for membership tier distribution
- Bar charts for monthly membership growth analysis
- Tables with conditional formatting to monitor client progress
- Slicers for interactive filtering by membership status
- Fitness-themed UI/UX layout to ensure clarity and engagement

I structured the dashboard to present high-level financial KPIs first, followed by operational and membership performance metrics for deeper analysis.

## Key Insights / Results
Through this dashboard, I identified:
- Strong financial performance with $4.1M in revenue, $1.2M in expenses, and $2.9M in profit.
- A workforce of 20 trainers managing 100 active clients, highlighting capacity considerations.
- Membership tier distribution showing stronger retention in Platinum compared to Silver tiers.
- Noticeable membership growth peaks in April and August, with lower engagement in February.
- Expired memberships concentrated in specific tiers, indicating potential churn reduction opportunities.
- Client membership progress ranging between 40%–50%, suggesting engagement tracking opportunities.

This analysis demonstrates how fitness and subscription-based business data can be leveraged to improve retention, optimize staffing levels, refine tier-based promotions, and drive sustainable revenue growth.

## What I Learned
Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:
- Build financial performance dashboards in Power BI
- Develop DAX measures for profit margin and growth analysis
- Analyze subscription lifecycle trends (active vs. expired memberships)
- Connect operational metrics (trainer count) to financial performance
- Design dashboards that balance financial insight with customer engagement metrics

I also gained practical insight into how membership-based business models rely heavily on retention optimization and seasonal growth patterns.

## Challenges I Encountered
One challenge I faced was accurately calculating profit margins and ensuring financial consistency across time periods. I addressed this by validating DAX measures and confirming that profit calculations aligned with revenue and expense totals.

Another challenge involved presenting both financial and membership metrics in a cohesive layout without overwhelming the viewer. I resolved this by grouping visuals into logical sections: Financial Performance, Membership Trends, and Client Activity.

Additionally, analyzing membership churn required careful filtering logic to separate active and expired members without misclassification.
